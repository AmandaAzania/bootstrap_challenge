                      <p> I have been working with Joshe for the past month as a colleague of Life Choices Academy coding
                        internship. Inside and outside the classroom Joshe's wonderful personality and intelligence makes her
                        presents warm welcoming. When working on a projects with Joshe she was always well informed and she's a
                        bit of a perfectionist these aspects alone made her a valued and respected team member. If you choose to
                        make her a part of your team and company you wont be dissapointed.</p>

                      <h5>Amanda Gudlwa</h5>
                      <p> Joshe is a person with a very positive out look on life, she is open minded and is tolerant of everyone.
                        She has her own strong beliefs, but she is also very respect other people's beliefs. I have known Joshe
                        for a month now. I was drawn to her from day one. She is able to hold conversation, and can fully engage
                        with any topic. I respect her work ethic, and her drive. she is a person that is able to move from not
                        knowing to knowing swiftly, because she understands herself, and how she learns best. As a team player,
                        she is a joy to work with, as she pulls her own weight and is a responsible, interactive person.</p>
